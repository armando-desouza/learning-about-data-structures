     <strong>Data Structures</strong> are the backbone of organizing and storing information in the world of computing. Imagine a gigantic closet with different compartments, each designed to store a specific type of object: clothes, books, clothing and others. Data structures work in a similar way, efficiently organizing and managing the data that feeds our software and systems.

     The term <i>"data structure"</i> emerged in the 1960s, with the publication of the book <strong>"Data Structures and Algorithms"</strong> by <i>Donald Knuth</i>. This seminal work consolidated the importance of data structures as a fundamental basis for computer science.

     Although official history credits Knuth with codifying the term, the idea behind data structures has been around for centuries. One of the first examples is the <strong>list</strong>, present in ancient civilizations to record inventories and transactions. Over time, this idea evolved into more complex forms, such as <strong>arrays</strong>, <strong>stacks</strong>, <strong>queues</strong>, <strong>trees</strong> and <strong> strong>graphs</strong>.

     Data structures permeate our daily digital lives, from the applications we use to the systems that manage large infrastructures. Let's look at some examples:
</p>

<ul

     <li>
         <strong>Databases:</strong> store and organize information about customers, products and transactions.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Image processing systems:</strong> manipulate and analyze digital images, such as photos and videos.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Search algorithms:</strong> allow you to quickly find information in large sets of data, such as on the internet.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Language compilers:</strong> translate source code into machine language so that computers can execute it.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Games:</strong> create interactive virtual worlds and simulate realistic behaviors.
     </li>
</ul>
