    TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURES
</h1>

     There are several types of data structures, each with its own characteristics and applications. The world of data structures is vast and fascinating, made up of diverse tools that organize and manage information efficiently. Each type has unique characteristics and applications, allowing software engineers to solve problems with creativity and power. Although it is not possible to list all existing data structures, we can explore the most common and important ones:
</p>

<strong>1. LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES</strong>

<p
     align="justify"
>
     Linear Data Structures are those that organize elements in a hierarchical or relational way, that is, in a logical and ordered sequence, allowing non-sequential access and complex relationships. In other words, each element has a predecessor and a successor, except the first and last elements, respectively. Some of the most common characteristics of linear data structures are:
</p>

<ul
     align="justify"
>
     <li>
         <strong>Sequence:</strong> the elements are arranged in a linear order, one after the other.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Sequential access:</strong> To access an element, it is often necessary to traverse the structure from the beginning.
     </li>
</ul>

<p

     Some of the most common types of linear data structures are:
</p>

<ul
     align="justify"
>
     <li>
         <strong>Array (Vector):</strong> store a collection of elements of fixed size and the same type, accessible by indexes. Ideal for quick index access and mathematical operations.
     </li>
     <li><strong>Linked list:</strong> stores elements in nodes linked by pointers. Allow efficient insertion and removal at any position, but index access may be slower.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Stack:</strong> a collection that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, where the last element to enter is the first to leave. useful for undoing actions, managing call stacks, and processing mathematical expressions.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Queue:</strong> a collection that follows the FIFO principle (First In, First Out), that is, the first element to enter is the first to leave. Ideal for queuing, data buffering and in-order processing of tasks.
     </li>
</ul>

<strong>2. NONLINEAR DATA STRUCTURES</strong>

<p
     align="justify"
>
     Non-Linear Data Structures are those in which the elements are not organized in a linear or ordered sequence. Instead, the elements are arranged so that a single element can be connected to multiple other elements, forming a hierarchical or network structure. Some of the characteristics of nonlinear data structures are:
</p>

<ul
     align="justify"
>
     <li>
         <strong>Hierarchy:</strong> elements can have one or more hierarchical relationships, such as parents and children.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Network Relationship:</strong> Elements can be interconnected in a complex way, similar to a network.
     </li>
</ul>

<p

     Some of the most common types of nonlinear data structures are:
</p>

<ul
     align="justify"
>
     <li>
         <strong>Trees:</strong> store elements in a hierarchy of nodes, where each node can have zero or more children. Useful for representing hierarchical structures such as directory trees, decision trees, and expression trees.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Graphs:</strong> store elements (vertices) and the connections between them (edges), which can represent complex networks such as social networks, city maps, transport routes and optimization problems.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Hash Tables:</strong> structures that map keys to values in a hash data structure, allowing fast access by key. Useful for implementing dictionaries, caches and NoSQL databases.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Sets:</strong> store unordered collections of unique elements, without duplicates. Ideal for checking the presence of elements, performing unions and intersections of sets and testing disjoint sets.
     </li>
</ul>

<strong>3. ADVANCED DATA STRUCTURES</strong>

<p

     Advanced Data Structures are fundamental blocks in organizing and manipulating information in algorithms and programs. They allow you to store, access and manage data efficiently and appropriately.
</p>

     Some of the most common types of advanced data structures are:
</p>

<ul
     align="justify"

     <li>
         <strong>Tries:</strong> specialized trees for efficient storage and searching of prefixed strings. Useful for word completion, packet routing and dictionary implementation.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Priority Queues (Heaps):</strong> tree-based data structures that guarantee that the element with the highest or lowest value is always at the root. Ideal for implementing priority queues, sorting algorithms, dijkstra algorithm and element selection
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Memory Blocks:</strong> Manage the allocation and deallocation of memory in blocks of variable sizes. Useful for optimizing memory usage in applications that frequently allocate and release memory.
     </li>
     <!-- <li>
         <strong>Dynamic Partition:</strong>
     </li> -->
</ul>
